>Things are going OK here at Plato's, but there's room for improvement. We've been collecting transactional data for the past year, but really haven't been able to put it to good use. Hoping you can analyze the data and put together a report to help us find opportunities to drive more sales and work more efficiently.
>
>Here are some questions that we'd like to be able to answer:
> - What days and times do we tend to be busiest?
> - How many pizzas are we making during peak periods?
> - What are our best and worst selling pizzas?
> - What's our average order value?
> - How well are we utilizing our seating capacity? (we have 15 tables and 60 seats)
>
>That's all I can think of for now, but if you have any other ideas I'd love to hear them â€“ you're the expert!
>Thanks in advance,
> Mario Maven (Manager, Plato's Pizza)

## 2. Assumptions and Insights

### 2.1 Assumptions
1. The earliest order was between 9 AM and 10 AM so I assumed that the operating hours for Plato's Pizza is between 09:00 to 23:59.
2. The days with no orders (#8 days) have not been assumed as holidays just days with no orders.
3. Sunday evening to Thursday evening for the purposes of analysis have been considered school nights
4. For the purposes of capacity analysis, I have assumed this is a dine in restaurant and have no take out orders irrespective of the time of order.
5. Small pizzas are consumed by an individual, Medium pizza is shared between 2 individuals, Large Pizzas are shared between 4 individuals, Xtra Large pizzas are shared between 6 individuals and Xtra Xtra Large pizzas are shared between 8.
6. For Table capacity Analysis it is assumed that 4 chairs are available to each table and table sharing is not permitted. Also, if there are 1 - 4 people in a group they will need one table, 5-8 people in a group will need 2 tables and so on.
7. Seat capacity analysis is independent of Table capacity analysis. It is not required for an individual to have a dedicated table to eat their pizza. Tables can be shared. Each individual requires a seat to eat pizzas.
8. Key metrics for analysis are Total Orders, Total Revenue, Average Revenue per Day/Hour , Average Orders per Day/ Hour, Average Revenue per order, Average Pizzas produced by Day/ Hour, Table Shortage, Seat Shortage, Days with no Table/Seat shortage (stockout).

 3. Busiest slots on Weekends is dinner between 5 PM to 7 PM.
 4. Brie Carre Pizza is the worst selling pizza with only 490 pizzas ($11,588) sold across the year probably because it's only sold in small sku. This is the second best selling small pizza by revenue $.

### 2.4 Recommendations
1. Average revenue generated between 9 AM to 10 AM is ~$0.2 per day, 10 AM to 11 AM is ~$0.8 per day and slot 11 PM to 12 AM is ~$3 per day which is less than minimum wage thus we recommend to change the opening hours from 11 AM (or 10:30 AM) to 11 PM.
