>Welcome aboard, we're glad you're here to help!

>Things are going OK here at Plato's, but there's room for improvement. We've been collecting transactional data for the past year, but really haven't been able to put it to good use. Hoping you can analyze the data and put together a report to help us find opportunities to drive more sales and work more efficiently.
>
>Here are some questions that we'd like to be able to answer:
> - What days and times do we tend to be busiest?
> - How many pizzas are we making during peak periods?
> - What are our best and worst selling pizzas?
> - What's our average order value?
> - How well are we utilizing our seating capacity? (we have 15 tables and 60 seats)
>
>That's all I can think of for now, but if you have any other ideas I'd love to hear them â€“ you're the expert!
>Thanks in advance,
> Mario Maven (Manager, Plato's Pizza)

## 2. Key Insights

### 2.1 Assumptions
1. The earliest order was between 9 AM and 10 AM so I assumed that the operating hours for Plato's Pizza is between 09:00 to 23:59.
2. The days with no orders (#8 days) have not been assumed as holidays just days with no orders.
3. Sunday evening to Thursday evening for the purposes of analysis have been considered school nights
4. For the purposes of capacity analysis, I have assumed this is a dine in restaurant and have no take out orders irrespective of the time of order.
5. Key metrics for analysis are Total Orders, Total Revenue, Average Revenue per Day/Hour , Average Orders per Day/ Hour, Average Revenue per order, Table Shortage, Seat Shortage, Days with no Table/Seat shortage (stockout).
